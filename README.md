This project demonstrates my understanding of trade execution strategies (primarily for equities and futures), focusing on the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and Average True Range (ATR). These indicators are essential to manage execution risk and market volatility in trading, and are also used in my extended trading strategy which I have coded. While the complete strategy is not shared publicly, I can discuss in more detail during interviews or screen shares.

VWAP: the VWAP is a benchmark used by portfolio managers and is an important execution strategy in low-touch trading. During my time at AXA Investment Managers, I spent time with the Head of Equity Execution Trading, where we discussed how VWAP is used to route trade orders via algowheels, allowing for efficient and low-impact order execution. It helps ensure trades are executed at an average price, minimising market impact.

ATR: the idea of implementing the ATR was due to my understanding of volatilty regimes, where periods of high volatility in asset prices are often followed by other periods of high volatility, and vice versa. An example would be when I spent time shadowing at the desk of AXA IM, market volatility across most asset classes was low. The FI market especially did not have much volatitlity. This meant large swings in price movement was unlikely, and this was demonstrated by low ATR values respective to other months, such as April. ATR is useful in determining risk management levels, for example my trading strategy's risk management is largely determined by market volatitly. It is intutitive, that high volatility means more slippage and worse price fills. This is partly due to sellside widening spreads, where they want to protect their inventory, fear of asymmetric information, or want to capitalise of buyside urgency. Also maximum adverse excursion is likely to be larger when volatility is high, which helps determine risk limits and position sizing.

Data: The data used in this project was sourced from CQG Quantower, connected to MotiveWave charting software, and then downloaded in CSV format. To process and manipulate the data, I imported it into Python using the Pandas library (abbreviated as pd). This allowed me to structure and format the data into a DataFrame, making it easy to calculate indicators ATR and VWAP.
